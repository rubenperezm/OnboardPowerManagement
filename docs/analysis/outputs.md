# Outputs Definition

This document defines the outputs produced by the Onboard Power Management Subsystem at a conceptual level.  
These outputs describe the information and commands generated by the subsystem and delivered to other subsystems or support functions.

---

## 1. Operational Outputs

Operational outputs describe the current operational state of the Power Management Subsystem.

### 1.1 Operational Mode

**Description:**  
The current operational mode of the subsystem.

**Possible values:**  
- NORMAL  
- SAFE  
- OFF  

**Recipients:**  
- SubsystemController  
- Telemetry and monitoring functions  

**Purpose:**  
To inform other subsystems of the current power management state and allow coordinated system behaviour.

---

## 2. Control Outputs

Control outputs represent commands issued by the Power Management Subsystem to influence the behaviour of other subsystems.

### 2.1 Load Control Commands

**Description:**  
Commands enabling or disabling electrical loads based on operational mode and power availability.

**Recipients:**  
- SubsystemController  

**Purpose:**  
To ensure that critical loads are powered according to system priorities and that non-essential loads are shed under degraded conditions.

---

## 3. Telemetry Outputs

Telemetry outputs provide monitoring and diagnostic information for analysis, validation, and debugging purposes.

### 3.1 Power Status Telemetry

**Description:**  
Reported status of the power subsystem, including aggregated health and status information.

**Recipients:**  
- TelemetryLogger  
- Ground or analysis tools (via simulation environment)  

**Purpose:**  
To support monitoring, verification, validation, and post-processing analysis of subsystem behaviour.

---

### 3.2 Mode Transition Events

**Description:**  
Notification of transitions between operational modes.

**Recipients:**  
- TelemetryLogger  

**Purpose:**  
To enable traceability of system behaviour and verification of correct mode transitions.

---

### 3.3 Fault and Health Reporting

**Description:**  
Reported health status and fault conditions detected by the subsystem.

**Recipients:**  
- TelemetryLogger  

**Purpose:**  
To support fault analysis, verification activities, and robustness assessment.

## 4. Notes

- Outputs defined in this document are conceptual and independent of implementation details.
- Data formats, communication topics, and timing constraints will be defined during the software design phase.
