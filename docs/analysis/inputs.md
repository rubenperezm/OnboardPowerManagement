# Power Manager Inputs Definition

This document identifies and describes the **inputs to the PowerManager module** within the Power Management Subsystem Simulator.

This activity corresponds to an early phase of the **software subsystem definition** and feeds subsequent requirements, interface, and design activities.

---

## 1. Definition

An input is defined as any piece of information that:

- Is not generated internally by the PowerManager
- Can change over time
- Can influence power management decisions
- Is received from an external module or system context

---

## 2. Input Categories

Power Manager inputs are grouped into the following categories to support clarity, modularity, and future interface definition.

---

### 2.1. Power-Related Measurements

These inputs represent simulated electrical measurements associated with the spacecraft power system.

#### 2.1.1. Battery Voltage
Represents the measured battery bus voltage provided by the power sensing subsystem.  
This input is critical for detecting undervoltage conditions and triggering protective actions.

#### 2.1.2. Battery Current
Represents the measured battery current, including charge and discharge behaviour.  
This input is used to detect abnormal current conditions and to support internal power state estimation.

#### 2.1.3. Battery Temperature
Represents the measured battery temperature.
This input provides contextual information that may influence operational limits or fault detection logic.

---

### 2.2 System and Operational Context

These inputs provide information about the operational context in which the Power Manager operates.

#### 2.2.1. Current Operational Mode
Indicates the current high-level operational mode of the spacecraft or subsystem (e.g. mission mode, safe mode).  
This input allows the Power Manager to apply mode-dependent decision logic.

#### 2.2.2. Load Demand Information
Represents power demand requests from downstream subsystems or simulated loads.  
This input allows prioritisation of power distribution and load shedding decisions.

---

### 2.3. Fault and Health

These inputs indicate degraded or off-nominal conditions affecting power management.

#### 2.3.1. Sensor Health Status
Indicates the validity or health status of incoming sensor measurements.  
This input allows the Power Manager to distinguish between real electrical anomalies and sensor failures.

#### 2.3.2. Power-Related Fault Flags
Represents detected fault conditions such as overcurrent, undervoltage, or power bus anomalies.  
These inputs may be generated by external monitoring functions or fault injection mechanisms.

---

### 2.4. Control and Configuration Inputs

These inputs allow external configuration or control of the Power Manager behaviour.

#### 2.4.1. Configuration Parameters
Represents configurable parameters such as thresholds, delays, or limits used by the Power Manager.
These inputs allow behaviour tuning without modifying core logic.

#### 2.4.2. External Commands
Represents external commands affecting power management behaviour, such as forcing a specific mode or resetting fault states.

---

## 3. Notes and Assumptions

- All inputs are assumed to be time-varying unless otherwise stated.
- Input data is assumed to be provided by external modules via well-defined interfaces.
- Detailed data types, ranges, units, and communication mechanisms are defined in subsequent interface and design documentation.
